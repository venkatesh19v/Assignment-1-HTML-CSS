        <b>About</b>
        <p>Audi has revealed its first all-electric Gran Turismo, the e-tron GT, and the first-ever RS all-electric car, the RS e-tron GT. Both models get dual motors backed up by a 95kWh battery.
           Design-wise, it retains the majority of the elements from its concept-spec model. It features a wide grille (closed for improved aerodynamics), LED headlamps with X-shaped DRLs that can be upgraded to Matrix Laser units and connected rear LED tail lamps. 
           The wheel options range from 19- to 21-inches and the 20- and 21-inch wheels get aerodynamic blades. Audi claims the e-tron Gran Turismo is one of the most aerodynamic cars, at 0.24cD. The India launch of the e-tron GT is yet to be determined, but if it happens, we expect it to come in 2022. It will rival the Porsche Taycan and the Tesla Model S. </p>
